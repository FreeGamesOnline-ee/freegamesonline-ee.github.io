**Geometry Lite** is a side-scrolling platformer mobile game created by Swedish game developer Robert Topala. It was released on 13 August 2013 for iOS and Android, with versions for Windows and macOS following on 22 December 2014. The player controls an icon to navigate music-based levels, avoiding obstacles like spikes.
The game comprises 26 full-length levels created by the developer: 22 are auto-scrolling, and 4 are 'platformer' levels. The game includes a level creation system, enabling players to design custom levels, share them online, and play levels created by other users. Players can collect in-game currency—such as stars, moons, coins, mana orbs and diamonds—from official and user-generated levels or chests.
